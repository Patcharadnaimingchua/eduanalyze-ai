// Shared shell for /login, /register and /forgot-password — a wider
// two-panel layout (brand panel + form), distinct from the (auth) route
// group's narrow single-card layout used by reset-password. Pages using
// this must live OUTSIDE app/(auth): that group's layout wraps children
// in max-w-md, which squeezes this grid and pushes the brand text out of
// the card.
//
// The brand panel's height is set by CSS Grid stretch to match its
// sibling (the form column) — on /register that column is much taller
// than one screen, so the panel's own box is much taller than the
// viewport too. Centering content with justify-center alone only
// centers it within that oversized box, not within what's actually
// visible on screen — the content can end up anywhere from the top to
// the bottom of the viewport depending on scroll position. The fix is a
// `position: sticky` content wrapper that stays pinned at the vertical
// center of the actual viewport as the page scrolls, decoupled from the
// panel's own (possibly much taller) box.
//
// `top-[50vh]` (not `top-1/2`) is deliberate: a percentage `top` on a
// sticky/relative/absolute element resolves against its *containing
// block's* height — and the parent here is `position: relative`, so
// `top-1/2` would peg it to 50% of the panel's own (grid-stretched,
// possibly 1300px+ tall) box, not 50% of the viewport, silently
// reproducing the exact bug this is fixing. `vh` is a viewport-relative
// length, not a percentage, so it bypasses containing-block resolution
// entirely and always means "half the real viewport height." The
// `-translate-y-1/2` half-height pull-up is unaffected by this — transform
// percentages resolve against the element's own box, never the
// containing block.
//
// The panel is a plain block (no flex/justify-center) on purpose —
// sticky + translate alone already centers correctly in both the short
// (login) and tall (register) case; adding flexbox justify-content on
// top of a sticky child changes how its static position is computed and
// fights the sticky offset, producing an inconsistent rest position.
// Don't reintroduce it as a "fallback" without re-verifying both pages.
//
// `position: sticky` breaks if any ancestor between it and the viewport
// has `overflow` other than `visible` — the old version's outer grid
// container used `overflow-hidden` purely to clip the two children's
// square corners into the container's own rounded ones. That's removed
// here; each panel now rounds its own outer corners instead, and the
// brand panel's decorative background/icon gets its own *local*
// overflow-hidden layer (a sibling of the sticky content, not an
// ancestor of it), so clipping and sticky positioning don't conflict.
// md:min-h-[34rem]: in a short panel the sticky content is clamped at the
// panel bottom and then pulled up by half its own height, so its top gap
// is roughly panelHeight - 1.5 x contentHeight (~326px desktop, ~349px at
// 768px). Forgot-password's single-field form alone gave a 334px card and
// the heading overhung the top. 34rem gives about login's own gaps, and
// is just under login's natural 550px, so login/register don't change.
// title/description are required (no default copy here) so each page owns
// its brand-panel message and a new page can't silently inherit another's.
