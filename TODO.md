## Backend & Data Issues

### ✓ On-track by Year Level (M20) — COMPLETE
Three commits delivered (2026-09-30):
- **A:** Prisma migration adds `Curriculum.durationYears` (default 4, 1-8 range), `CreateCurriculumDto` field, year-level helper in `apps/backend/src/common/academic/year-level.ts` with formula `expected = min(total, ceil(total × max(0, currentYear − admissionYear) / durationYears))`, and dashboard fields `yearLevel`, `expectedCredits`, `onTrackStatus`.
- **B:** Student dashboard credits card shows amber "ตามหลังแผน" or emerald "ตามแผน" badge; admin curriculum form has `durationYears` field (default 4, validation 1-8).
- **C:** Year Level Overview (STAFF/INSTRUCTOR) shows "ตามหลังแผน N" badge on year cards and student rows, reusing the same pure helpers.

## Known Technical Debt

### Backend ESLint Config (pre-existing)
`apps/backend/` has no ESLint setup. Tests (Jest 96/96), TypeScript (`tsc`), and Prisma migrations are the current gates. This is a pre-existing issue outside the M20 scope but noted here for future build-quality work.
